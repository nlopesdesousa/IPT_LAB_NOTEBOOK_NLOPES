    "\n",
    "Prior to this day, a rice with holes was successfully prepared by Nassia’s mother. The experiment was conducted in a large saucepan, using long-grain parboiled rice and a lid. This result will be taken as a reference and we will try to recreate it.\\\n",
    "<img src=\"riz_maman.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The following procedure was followed : Before puting the lid, the system Rice+Water is brought to a boil at high heat. When the bubbles begin to appear the heat is reduced to medium-low and the lid is put.\n",
    "\n",
    "First attempt of the day : Lid used, long-grain parboiled rice, heated over medium heat until boiling for $20$min. Rice: $136\\pm1$g, Water: $300\\pm1$g, the pan diameter is around $15$cm.\\\n",
    "<img src=\"long_grain_1.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations :**\n",
    "1. Experiment recreation succesfull !\n",
    "2. Uniform distribution of the holes.\n",
    "3. Top layer more dry that the reference rice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses :**\n",
    "1. Type of rice has a big incidence on the results\n",
    "2. The experiment was also involving more rice, to test this incidence we conduct the next attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second attempt (less rice, also to prevent waste, less time cooking) : Lid used, long-grain parboiled rice, heated over medium-high heat until boiling for 11 minutes.\n",
    "Rice: $91\\pm1$g, Water: $206\\pm1$g.\n",

    "1. Confirmation that with this type of rice the holes phenomenon apprears (big incidence of the type of rice)\n",
    "2. Using less rice result in less deep holes, so less visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third attempt : Lid used, long-grain parboiled rice, heated over medium-low heat aftetr boiling and cooked for 16 minutes. Rice: $85\\pm1$g, Water: $199\\pm1$g.\n",

    "**Hypotheses :**\n",
    "1. The formation of holes is from the top to the bottom, because when a similar system is cooked longer the holes are more visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth attempt (influence of water) : Lid used, long-grain parboiled rice, heated over medium-low heat after boiling and cooked for 23 minutes. Rice: $86\\pm1$g, Water: $304\\pm1$g.\n",

    "**Observations :**\n",
    "1. Clearly visible holes !\n",
    "2. The top layer looks very flat\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses :**\n",
    "1. An increase in the amount of water appears to reduce the formation of holes. This could be explained by the excessive presence of water, which allows the rice grains to slide relative to one another, thereby preventing hole formation and leading to a more uniform grain arrangement.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we also question whether the locations of bubble nucleation in the pan influence the positions where holes appear in the rice. To investigate this, the bubble nucleation sites were filmed in a pan filled with water, without a lid."

    "**Observations :**\n",
    "1. After approximately 18 minutes of cooking, small holes formed near the edges, while a surface film developed that prevented some bubbles in the center from bursting at the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses :**\n",
    "1. Holes consistently appear with this type of rice; however, rather than promoting their formation, risotto rice seems to inhibit the development of some holes. Because of its high starch content, starch accumulates in the water and forms a highly concentrated film at the surface. This likely increases the effective surface tension, preventing some bubbles from breaking through the surface and, consequently, inhibiting the formation of holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current experiment idea :**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a lid until the water level reaches the rice surface, then take a photograph to identify the bubble nucleation sites; subsequently cover the pan again and observe whether the bubbles continue to emerge at the same locations.\n",
    "2. Stop the cooking earlier, at the moment when “chimneys” first appear at the surface, in order to determine whether these structures truly form from the top. If this hypothesis is correct, the structure beneath the initial holes should be unstable and exhibit noticeable motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sixth attempt (return on long grain but experimentation with boiling phase) : Parboiled long-grain rice, covered with lid but not continuously; heated at maximum power until boiling, then at medium–low heat. The total time is unclear because different phase of low, medium, without, with lid were experimented. The Goal was to understand the reaction of the system when influencing the boiling. Rice : $87.0\\pm 0.1$g; water : $210.9\\pm 0.1$g.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations :**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the water level gradually decreased, distinct bubbling regions appeared at the surface (areas with no bubbles and areas with active bubbling). At this stage, the lid was lifted to photograph these regions in order to later compare them with the final spatial distribution of holes. It was then observed that the surface bubbling progressively weakened and eventually disappeared. This is interpreted as a sudden decrease in surface temperature : boiling could no longer be sustained because bubbles rising from the bottom of the pan were unable to burst at a surface that had cooled significantly. After the lid was replaced, the system gradually reheated and new bubbles began to burst at the surface again. At that point, fewer potential holes—through which bubbles could escape—were observed to form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses :**\n",
    "\n",
    "The force that had previously pushed the rice grains apart around a “chimney” through which a bubble emerged was abruptly suppressed. Since the rice was still largely immersed in water, the grains were able to slide and collapse back, closing the hole once this force vanished. When the rice subsequently reached a temperature high enough to sustain boiling again, the potential holes had partially closed, and a significant fraction of the water had already evaporated. As a result, the upper rice layer began to dry and stick together, which hindered the formation of larger and more stable chimneys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation of the idea :\\\n",
    "When the water level dropped below the level of the rice, the pan was removed from the hotplate and subjected to small, abrupt motions in order to mechanically perturb the material. It was clearly observed that the upper layer remained essentially rigid and immobile, while the underlying layers were unstable and easily displaced or disrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seventh attempt (increase of the quantity without changing the ratio to see if the thickness of the system has an influence) : With a lid, parboiled long-grain rice, heated at maximum power until boiling, then maintained at medium–low heat for 20 minutes. Rice: $214.7\\pm 0.1$g, water: $402.6\\pm 0.1$g.\n",

    "1. The holes are very visible, probably due to the thickness, which leads to deeper holes."
