    "Reference experiment was prepared using long-grain rice (Alnatura, Migros). The system was brought to boiling without a lid at maximum heat, then the heat was reduced to medium–low and a lid was added to sustain boiling : rice $61.7\\pm 0.1$g, water $156.5\\pm 0.1$g, cooking time $18$ min $46$ s (note: for this specific rice brand, soaking for few seconds before cooking already leads to the formation of rice agglomerates, which did not appear for the previous one).\n",
