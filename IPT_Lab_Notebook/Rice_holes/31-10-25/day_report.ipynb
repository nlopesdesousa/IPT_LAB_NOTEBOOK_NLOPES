    "15h : Began working in parallel on the “Rice holes” experiment, purchasing basmati rice (M-budget), acquiring a pan, and moving to room 401. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement :**\n",
    "If you do the rice cooking without ever stirring it, you will find out that your well-cooked and tasty rice shows a pattern of holes like the one in the picture. Can you suggest a physical explanation for the phenomenon? Identify the relevant parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "16h : First attempt at forming the rice holes, using $80\\pm1$g of rice, $148\\pm1$g of water, in a container with diameter $12.3\\pm0.1$cm and height $6.2\\pm0.1$cm, heated over medium heat on a hotplate during 13 minutes. (see [Rice table](../Rice_attempt_summary/rice_attemp_table.ipynb) for more detail of the parameter for each experiment)\n",

    "**Observations :**\n",
    "1. Few or no holes formed.\n",
    "2. After stirring and scooping, the bottom remains wet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses :**\n",
    "1. Starch concentration may be too low in the water.\n",
    "2. Without a lid, moisture is not retained, causing the top layer of rice to dry out\n",
    "3. The hotplate temperature may be too high, accelerating evaporation before the starch can form binding\n",
    "4. Grain shape may be too short or too thin, preventing the formation of a dense or compact structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second attempt (less water) : $80\\pm1$g of rice, $120\\pm1$g of water, in a container with same diameter, heated over medium heat on a hotplate during $13$min. One parameter that was not controlled is whether the rice was evenly distributed throughout the pan; it may be useful to include a step prior to cooking to ensure a homogeneous distribution.\\\n",
    "<img src=\"riz_basmati2.jpeg\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations :**\n",
    "1. The top layer of grains is drier than before.\n",
    "2. Fewer holes are present.\n",
    "3. Moisture at the bottom is similar to the previous case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third attempt (with lid) : $80\\pm1$g of rice, $148\\pm1$g of water, same pan, heated over medium heat on a hotplate with a lid (containing a small hole) during $13$min.\\\n",

    "\n",
    "**Observations :**\n",
    "1. No particular changes apart the fact that the top layer looks more moist\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "**List of ideas for future experiments :**\n",
    "1. Heat the water separately to control its temperature, then add the rice afterward.\n",
    "2. Soak the rice in water for a certain period before cooking."
