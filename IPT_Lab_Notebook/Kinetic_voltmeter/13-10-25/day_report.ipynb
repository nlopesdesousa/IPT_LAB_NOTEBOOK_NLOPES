    "Therefore, several hypotheses arise:\n",
    "The measured $\\tau$ is most likely dominated by the tuning fork’s own $\\tau$, which seems plausible given its high quality factor. To confirm this, $\\tau$ should be measured for the tuning fork alone, without coupling to either the box or the battery. Since the $\\tau$ values obtained for the empty box and for the box containing a battery were roughly the same, it is reasonable to assume that the $\\tau$ of the battery–box–tuning fork coupling is in fact dominated by the box–tuning fork coupling (at least within the precision range achievable in our setup). \\\n",
    "In any case, the battery’s contribution is not measurable, and moreover, it seems that the box itself overwhelms the battery in terms of damping effect. Consequently, the idea of transferring energy from the tuning fork to the battery can be reasonably abandoned unless there is a major improvement in the setup. This will be confirmed after measuring $\\tau$ for the tuning fork alone, but given the expected orders of magnitude, attempting a stronger battery–box coupling is not worthwhile. \\\n",
    "Since the tuning fork appears to dominate the system, it might be more sensible to focus only on the box and the battery. Two experimental options emerge :\n",
    "1. Place the battery inside the box and strike the box — but this is already ruled out by previous observations, as the box almost certainly dominates the response, and the short, broadband impulse makes it unlikely that any consistent interaction with the battery occurs during the audible decay.\n",
    "2. Drop the battery onto the box (or another surface) and analyze the dominant frequencies to check for variations between batteries, or alternatively, study the decay of these frequencies (though this strongly depends on the box’s own resonant frequencies, so the approach will require careful consideration)."
