    "8h-9h : Discussion on the interpretation model of the problem and exploration of new conceptual directions, with a particular focus on the role of the anode in wave transmission. Two competing descriptions of the phenomenon in the **low-energy** regime were discussed :\n",
    "1. The energy is sufficiently low that most of it is dissipated by the casing, with only a small fraction dissipated within the anode of the discharged battery\n",
    "2. The energy is transmitted throughout the entire battery in a similar manner, regardless of whether the battery is charged or discharged.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Consideration was also given to a compression test of the battery, with the idea of measuring the compressive resistance force for batteries at different states of charge, which is expected to differ. A decision was made to first consult Antonio and Daniele Mari regarding the feasibility of opening batteries longitudinally, and subsequently to assess whether a compression-based approach would be viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "10h : Compression tests were attempted using hydraulic presses. The results were inconclusive, as compression along the longitudinal axis (where the anode is expected to have a stronger influence) led to the positive terminal being easily pushed into the battery, largely independent of the internal structure. In addition, practical difficulties arose in defining a meaningful “compressive resistance,” since the available hydraulic presses measure only the applied force. In parallel, two batteries with different states of charge were cut longitudinally. \n",

    "The following conclusions were drawn:\n",
    "1. The proportion of the anode relative to the overall battery structure is smaller than initially anticipated; the cathode, which has a relatively compact and friable structure, nevertheless occupies a significant fraction of the battery volume.\n",
    "2. The charged battery contained liquid water, which leaked out during cutting.\n",
    "3. Clear structural differences in the anode were observed : in the charged battery, the anode consisted of a malleable paste that retained its shape after deformation and remained slightly moist, whereas in the discharged battery the anode was more rigid, still paste-like but friable and dry.\n",
    "4. The first transmission hypothesis appears to be the most plausible : at low energies, the anode is not subjected to significant forces, and the overall structure therefore transmits vibrations efficiently, with little effective dissipation.\n",

    "11h : return to the room, discussion and improvement of the setup for noise measurements by adding a angle to the battery position to optimise the surface of the impact.\n",

    "*Additional idea : rotate batteries at very high angular velocity (very large centrifugal force), so that the zinc paste accumulates at the edges of the battery. This would result in differences in the moment of inertia.*\n",

    "12h : we realize that the sound measurement setup had in fact not been restored exactly as in the first experiment, since the damping mat underneath the structure was missing. However, despite this correction, we are unable to reproduce the peaks previously observed [during day 31/10/25](../31-10-25/day_report.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, we retrieve a new floppy disk for data recording and a spectrum analyzer capable of inducing a higher voltage (up to 100 V). After experimenting with the device throughout the day, we realize that it is not possible, on the one hand, to apply 100 V at the input, and on the other hand, to use it as a network analyzer, which is required for our measurements. We could investigate this device more thoroughly in the future, but for the time being it seems more judicious to focus on the other tasks to be completed.\n",

    "14h - 17h : the rest of the day was devoted to an IPT meeting with all members to decide which problems would be selected for presentation and discussion. A new research avenue was also proposed by Ghita, suggesting the use of machine learning to classify batteries based on the acoustic signals generated by an impact. To this end, we discussed an experimental protocol to accurately record impact sounds using the previous setup (with improvements), while collecting a large number of both charged and discharged batteries—this time from different brands to ensure that observed discharge-related properties are not confounded with manufacturing differences."
