The end Volt on the device is set to 1.0V (which according to our research is a acceptable tension for a used battery, could be dangerous otherwise), the capacity (mesured by the device) at 1550 mAh and the constant current is set to 0.5 A"

    "9h30 : while the battery is discharging, research how to approach the explanation of the chemical aspect of the problem \\\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ there are possible tests, but they require advanced and technical measuring equipment that may not be available on campus. Moreover, the measurements can be time-consuming \\\n",
    "10h-11h : Discussion with Mr. Ansermet and Mael, leading to a reassessment of how to approach the problem, as there is already extensive literature on the topic, leaving us with little room to explore the additionnal relevant explanatory aspect further \\\n",
    "11h30 : Successful battery discharge test using the discharging device, which allows for a controlled constant discharge current, followed by a deeper review of the existing literature in order to focus on proposing and optimizing a personal alternative method, which according to us will be more interessant and relevant than just redoing tests that have already been conducted with better devices and more time \\\n",
    "12h : lunch break \\\n",
    "13h-15h : internet researches on alternative method approaches. \\\n",
    "Ideas : \n",
    "1. explore the damping property or resonance of the battery following excitation (acoustic, vibration)\n",
    "2. study the transmission of ultrasound through the battery and analyze the resulting waves\n",
    "3. study of plastic propriety of the battery, like maybe internal friction, elasticity, compression, torsion\n",
    "\n",
    "After presentation of ideas with M. Mari, conclusion that some of them were not achievable on the campus (like the ultrasound testing), other were not developped enough to asses achievability and suggestion of the torsion experiment (TP D1). Request for the fabrication of a support adapted to the battery in order to carry out torsion tests, to evaluate the level of damping depending on the internal structure of the battery – likely to be available by the following week.\n",
    "16h : Found out that the discharge time of a battery is long (takes more than 3 hours). It will be necessary to come during the week to be able to discharge several batteries for varying lengths of time and have the possibility to run tests \\\n",
    "16h30 : Better understanding of the discharge device, deductions based on multiple tests throughout the day:\n",
    "1. If the current is too high, the discharge stops quickly even though the battery still holds energy (but not enough for the chosen current) $\\rightarrow$ therefore, discharges should be done at lower currents to consume more energy. The most suitable current balancing discharge rate and discharge time was set at 0.5 A.\n",
    "2. The end voltage of 1.0 V is not low enough to satisfactorily discharge the battery; it can be set to 0.1 V before starting the discharge.\n",
    "3. The most satisfactory procedure chosen is as follows : set the initial parameters such as capacity 1550 mAh, current 0.5 A, end voltage 0.1 V, and start the discharge. Produce different charge states by subjecting various batteries to the discharger for varying lengths of time, so that the consumed capacities (provided by the discharger) increase in increments of 100 mAh. The batteries are then numbered, and their data are entered into a table (see [State Charge Table](../charge_state_table.ipynb)) that will be filled throughout the week with their consumed capacity and discharge time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives for next week: \\\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ Do more research in the aim of finding an experimental setup and protocol to test the battery’s vibration according to its state of charge \\\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ Do more research in the aim of finding an experimental setup and protocol to test the battery’s acoustic response according to its state of charge\\\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ Establish different battery states of charge\\\n",
    "$\\rightarrow$ Conduct the torsion experiment TP2 D1 if the battery supports are ready"
