    "#### Weeks report\n",
    "\n",
    "The past two weeks were dedicated to refining both the resonance measurement method using piezoelectric sensors and the classification approach with machine learning, as well as to preparing and practicing the “fights” for the final on December 13, 2025. As the resarch process was mostly done, the LabNotebook was completed with less details. This report presents a summary of the main conclusions.\n",

    "Regarding the piezoelectric measurements, we focused on confirming the observed trends using only the old piezos. We observed a decrease in the quality factor with an approximately linear trend, analyzing primarily the main peak using\n",

    "with $\\Delta f$ the full width at half maximum of the peak. The experimental variation is relatively large, partly explained by cable resonances, as previously discussed. Another source of error may be related to mechanical clamping : the measured values strongly depend on the applied clamping force, and an undesired effect is that the quality factor—and thus damping—also depends on the clamping. When the setup is tightened excessively, an artificial damping is introduced, saturating the phenomenon and preventing any trend from being observed. To address this, the setup was given the minimum clamping required to obtain a measurable gain curve, allowing the trend to be observed while reducing uncertainty associated with clamping. The experiment was then repeated six times to achieve reasonable statistical significance, yielding the resulting gain curve.\n",
