    "Consequently, the clamping force, provided it remains constant over time, has no influence on the recorded signal. This conclusion allowed the experiment to be conducted with the setup oriented vertically, as the imposed deformation was constant and did not impact the measurement.\n",
    "This configuration offered practical advantages, notably easier battery replacement and the possibility of applying only minimal clamping, sufficient to ensure mechanical contact between the piezoelectric element and the battery surfaces. Measurements performed under this configuration yielded results consistent with those obtained previously."

    "Additional tests were performed using samples other than batteries in order to identify another object that might exhibit similar behavior in terms of density. Experiments were conducted using materials that appeared to be aluminum (easily deformable) and iron. In these cases, no measurable offset was observed, which was inconsistent with our initial hypothesis based on modeling the system as springs with different stiffnesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to the realization that the main difference between the two experiments (with metallic samples versus batteries) is that batteries are electrically charged and exhibit a potential difference between their terminals. Charged batteries present a voltage of approximately 1.5 V, while discharged batteries exhibit voltages around 1.2 V, values that are strikingly close to the offsets measured by our experimental setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the exact mechanism by which the piezoelectric sensor detects this voltage is not fully understood, it is likely that, since the surface of the piezoelectric element is in direct contact with the battery, the sensor effectively measures the electrical potential difference. Consequently, the experiment does not purely probe a mechanical effect but rather behaves as a voltage measurement, similar to a voltmeter, and therefore constitutes an electrical rather than a mechanical method."

    "The next steps are somewhat difficult to define. A wide range of approaches was nevertheless explored, sufficient to conclude that the problem was thoroughly investigated. However, none of the tested ideas led to exploitable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining potential directions include introducing a controlled compression prior to deformation. Indeed, using the different in bulk modulus, and so of elasticity, of the material the idea could be to compress the battery and measure the force of the resistance to the compression. By staying in the elastic regime, and evalutation the strain-stress curve, one might be able to identify a Young modulus."
