    "##### Problem statement :\n",
    "« A DIY method of testing the charge of a battery is to drop it on a hard surface and observe whether it bounces. Explain the phenomenon and find other non-invasive mechanical methods to estimate the remaining charge. Optimize the accuracy of your method. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suH32X91sQE »\n",

    "##### Questions/ideas : \n",
    "- test on different brand and on rechargeable batteries\n",
    "- dependance on batterie type, size, form\n",
    "- effect of batteries combinaison (parallel, serie)\n",
    "- does bouncing technique stop working at some point ?\n",
    "- at which state of the battery is the bouncing test working ?\n",
    "- on which surface is the test the more accurate ?\n",
    "- type of bouncing, height (TP bouncing balls?), find a formula that connects bouncing to battery state\n",
    "- try find a way to evaluate the fiability of the bouncing test\n",

    "essentially composed of a cathode (+) (mix manganese + graphite) and an anode (-) (mix powdered zinc + gel agent) electrically isolated. Electron flow possible through chemical reactions (oxydation - reduction) that either free electron that accumulate in the anonde (oxydation), or use electron for a reaction (reduction). A potential different is induced by accumulation of electron on - extremity that is measurable with voltmeter. The pushed force comes from repulsive coulomb force between electrons that will try to reach the point with less electron (cathode if circuit allows it). The chemical reaction runs if battery is in a circuit, but can be slowed down by the fact that the chemical reaction decreases with use. The lifetime depends on chemical energy quantity at the beginning, the energy quantity required by the charges in the circuit, the age and the temperature of the battery)\n",

    "1. « Battery Bounce Test - tell full from empty by dropping it! » https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suH32X91sQE \\\n",
    "Several tests on different surface and brand of AA alkaline batteries to tell a full AA alkaline battery from an empty one just by dropping it. The full battery doesn't bounce, the empty one does bounce.\n",

    "2. « Battery bounce test at idle – Why do they bounce when they are dead? » https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Hro4Ud7-I \\\n",
    "Bouncing tests on different alkaline batteries, slow-motion video of the fall and the resulting bouncing. Some battery bounces more than other. Bulding of an experimental setup to be able to drop all the batteries at the same time and from the same height. Shows differences in texture of the inside components of a charged and empty battery, mentions that the bouncing is a result of the gel-like texture of the anode part of the battery, which solidify when the battery is empty. specifies that this test is only relevant for alkaline batteries.\n",
