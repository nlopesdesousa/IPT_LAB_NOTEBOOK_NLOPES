Percussion techniques that exploit the interaction between air, water, and hands: striking the surface, using the impact of droplets on the surface, creating waves, changing the shape of the impact surface, etc. The video highlights the connection between the interaction of water, the shape of the cavity, and the resulting sound.\n",

Various techniques: tapping with fingers or the palm of the hand, flicking, letting droplets or a stream of water fall, resonating a sound on the water surface, striking a cup with its base or its opening, hitting the back of a wooden bowl/metal cones half-immersed in water, immersing a vibrating gong in water.\n",

High-speed imaging experiments show that detached plumes oscillate and produce low-frequency sounds (depending on plume size, jet velocity, and container geometry).

    "In summary: there is quite a lot of documentation studying the generation of sound with water, but many of them focus on underwater sounds. I tried to gather those that could also investigate the case of sound in air, though it remains to be seen whether sound generated underwater would also fit the topic. There are numerous avenues to test different sound-producing techniques (some artists even specialize in this). The next step is to be able to record the sound properly, and perhaps even film the technique, to understand what produces a certain type of sound and through which interaction—most likely, multiple effects will overlap.\n"
